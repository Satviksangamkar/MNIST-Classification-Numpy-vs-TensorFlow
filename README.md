## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start experimenting with the code:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Satviksangamkar/MNIST-Classification-Numpy-vs-TensorFlow.git
cd MNIST-Classification-Numpy-vs-TensorFlow
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows use env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy pillow matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras jupyterlab
```

### 4. Download the MNIST Dataset

Obtain the MNIST dataset CSV files from Kaggle and place them in the root directory of the repository.

### 5. Run the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebooks:

```sh
jupyter lab # Or jupyter notebook for the classic interface
```

Open each notebook (`MNIST_Classification_Numpy_NeuralNetwork.ipynb`, `MNIST_Classification_TensorFlow_DeepNN.ipynb`, `MNIST_Classification_TensorFlow_Keras_CNN.ipynb`) to run the code and explore the implementations.

## üì∏ Example Predictions

You can visualize predictions and test the models with your own images. Here's a sample of how to use the trained models to predict digits from images.

**Image Example:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

def display_image(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
    plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

image_path = 'sample_image-300x298.webp'
display_image(image_path)
```
